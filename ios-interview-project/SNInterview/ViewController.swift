        CoffeeShop(name:"Blue Bottle", review: "The place was empty the afternoon I came in, so I was able to quickly place an order for their version of a New Orleans cold brew. I received my drink right as my credit card order went through.", rating: 3),
        CoffeeShop(name:"Bird Rock", review: "When it comes to environment and ambience, this place is amazing! It has a cute lil look, yet looks a bit modern. It's very eye appealing and I would definitely deem Instagramable.", rating: 3),
