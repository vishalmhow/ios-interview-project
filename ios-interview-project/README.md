# Project
This is a simple project that shows a list of local coffee shop reviews

## Details
- Please use git and commit often with meaningful commit messages, just as you would when working on a team.
- You should fix any memory leaks, retention cycles, crashes, or bad practices you might find.
- Verify that the code is working properly.
- If you make an assumption during this exercise, run with it, but please write it down in a comment so we know the assumption when reviewing the code.

## Exercise 1
- Replace UIStackView with UITableView (reuse CoffeeShopItemView and use auto-resizeable cells)
- Upon tapping a cell, show a view displaying the review

## Exercise 2
Load reviews from provided `CoffeeShops.json` file instead of the hard-coded array in UIViewController. Base your implementation on the assumption that the JSON will be retrieved from a remote server in the future.

## Extra Credit
- Feel free to improve the project in any way you see fit (UX/UI, code structure, etc) and explain your enhancements in comments.

## When you are done
Zip the project using the provided script in project root and email the zip file back to the recruiter.
